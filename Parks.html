    <h1>Parks in Tampere</h1>
    <p>
      Tampere is a green city of lakes and ridges. A fifth of the city's
      surface area is composed of green areas, and these include not only
      constructed parks but also forests and open areas.

      Tampere green areas can be sorted into different types based on their
      purpose of use and natural characteristics:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em class="park-types">The central parks</em> are relatively small, high-quality green areas
      intended primarily for rest and recreation. Their central location means
      that they are important for the urban landscape, so they require
      high-quality construction and maintenance. These parks include Koskipuisto
      Park, Kirjastonpuisto Park and Hämeenpuisto Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em class="park-types">Local parks</em> are functional parks that are reserved for play, rest
      and recreation and are connected to nearby housing. Local parks are
      located in population centres within walking distance of housing areas.
      The smallest local parks are usually constructed parks, but the larger
      ones have natural areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em class="park-types">District parks</em> are activity-focused parks that are intended for
      residents’ daily use and are more extensive than local parks. These parks
      usually contain both constructed and natural parts. The constructed areas
      include various functional green services, such as playgrounds, fields and
      courts for ball sports and other sports, and recreational routes. The
      district parks include Isolammenpuisto Park in Kaukajärvi and Atalanpuisto
      Park in Atala.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em class="park-types">Regional parks</em> are large recreational areas that are mostly natural
      and are located between urban districts. They are the core areas of the
      local ecological network, and they include areas reserved for outdoor
      recreation, physical training and sports, including sports fields and
      courts, local sports facilities and allotments. The regional parks include
      Pyynikki, Kauppi and the shores of Lake Iidesjärvi.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em class="park-types">The routes</em> located in green areas are important green services.
      Depending on the surrounding terrain and purpose, the routes are either
      corridors or lightly constructed paths. These various park corridors,
      outdoor recreation routes, and pedestrian and bicycle routes form a
      comprehensive network of recreational routes throughout the city.
