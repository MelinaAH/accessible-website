    <h1>History of Tampere</h1>
    <p>
      The habitation on the narrow neck of land between Lake Näsijärvi and
      Lake Pyhäjärvi, right at the crossroads of the northern and southern
      waterways, dates back as far as to the 7th century. In the 13th century,
      the area began to develop into an important trading place. In the 18th
      century, the Tammerkoski rapids that connect the two local lakes were
      discovered as a significant source of hydropower. By decision of King
      Gustav III of Sweden, a new city – Tampere – was established in the
      Swedish realm in 1779. At the time, the land area of the city reached
      from the Tammerkoski rapids to the border of Pispala (3.2 square
      kilometres), and there were less than 200 inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1950 the population passed the 100 000 mark, and in 2003 there were
      already 200 000 inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In slightly over two centuries that modest village has been expanded
      into a vibrant city with over 255,000 inhabitants. Today, Tampere is
      the third largest municipality and the second largest urban area in
      Finland. Thanks to regional mergers, the total surface area of Tampere
      has increased from approximately three to just under 700 square
      kilometres.

      In the 1820s, Tampere took the first steps toward becoming the first
      industrial city in Finland. Of the early industrial facilities, the most
      notable one was the cotton mill founded by the Scottish-born James
      Finlayson and further developed by Wilhelm Nottbeck. The development of
      actual large-scale industrial life in Tampere began in the 1850s. In
      addition to the textile industry, the most prominent industrial fields
      were the metal, iron, and wood processing industries, followed later by
      the shoe and leather industries. The strong industrialisation had
      a distinctly visible impact on the city both externally and internally:
      the red-brick factories and chimneys along the banks of the Tammerkoski
      rapids became elements for which Tampere would be known for decades to
      come. The population of Tampere increased rapidly toward the end of the
      1800s, and at the turn of the century, there were 35,000 people living
      in the city. Most of them belonged to the working class and worked in
      the local factories.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Finnish Civil War that followed the country’s newly declared
      independence, the decisive battles took place in Tampere in the spring
      of 1918. Even after the war, Tampere remained the centre of the Finnish
      textile industry; Finlayson, Pellavatehdas and Suomen Trikoo Oy were
      among the largest textile industry companies in the Nordic countries.
      After the Second World War, the manufacture of war reparation products
      boosted the metal industry in Tampere, which further increased the
      numbers of the working age population. A significant regional merger
      took place in 1947 when Messukylä was annexed to Tampere, and shortly
      after that the construction of the eastern urban areas of Kaleva and
      Kissanmaa was commenced. In 1950, the population of Tampere exceeded
      100,000 inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to significant equity funding, the strong industrialisation
      also required world-class technical expertise. The city managed to
      maintain this level of competence even after the old industrial fields
      gradually began to give way to new ones. The modernisation of
      traditional skills and competencies was made possible by the
      establishment of higher education institutions in Tampere: In the 1960s,
      Tampere saw the establishment of a university and a school of technology
      (now merged into the new Tampere University) alongside the pre-existing
      secondary-level institutions, and the technology centres of Hermia and
      Finnmedi followed a little later. As a result of this structural change,
      Tampere became the centre of modern state-of-the-art technology: The
      strengths of the city included vehicle engineering and automation,
      medical technology, information technology, and communications and
      new media.

      In Tampere, life has never been just about the work; instead, arduous
      labour has always been balanced off by a vibrant and diverse cultural
      life. Tampere has had a high-quality library institution – which is an
      essential part of the Finnish culture – already in the 19th century.
      Moreover, the strong labour movement in Tampere led to the establishment
      of the country's first centre for popular education, the adult education
      centre of Tampere. Around that same time, Tampere was also turning into
      Finland's most prominent theatre city. Today, there are more than a dozen
      professional theatres operating in the city. Moreover, Tampere is renowned as the city of
      writers and literature – a reputation which is based particularly on
      the emergence of strong prose authors that began in the 1950s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tampere is also a famous and versatile sports city. Tampere is
      particularly known as the birthplace of Finnish ice hockey, as this is
      where it all began in 1926. Furthermore, both European and World
      Championships in a variety of different sports have been organised in
      Tampere over the decades. The 2022 IIHF Men's Ice Hockey World
      Championship were played in Tampere and Helsinki 13.-29.5.2022.
      The 2023 IIHF Men's Ice Hockey World Championship were played in Tampere
      and Riga, Latvia 12.-28.5.2023. The games were played at the Nokia Arena
      in Tampere, which was completed at the end of 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      The largest conference and concert centre in the Nordic countries,
      Tampere Hall, was built in 1990. It strengthened the city's music sector
      and made Tampere an important meeting and conference city even by
      international standards. Completed in 2021, the Nokia Arena is an
      entertainment centre in the heart of Tampere, which opened a new era of
      event experiences in Tampere. The arena has up to 15 000 seats, a hotel,
      a wide range of event facilities and numerous restaurants. The design
      language of the arena and the Tampere Deck is the work
      of internationally renowned architect Daniel Libeskind.
